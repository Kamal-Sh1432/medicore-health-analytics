This engagement reflects real-world healthcare analytics work carried out for a multi-hospital healthcare organization operating at scale.

Senior leadership was facing persistent challenges such as:

High appointment no-show rates

Inefficient doctor utilization

Limited visibility into future operational risks

The objective was to move from reactive reporting to predictive, insight-driven decision-making.

##Project Objectives

Reduce appointment no-show rates through predictive insights

Improve doctor utilization and capacity planning

Identify revenue recovery opportunities

Enable leadership with clear, actionable analytics

##My Role — Analytics Consultant

I worked closely with business and leadership stakeholders to deliver this engagement end to end:

Translated leadership concerns into measurable KPIs

Defined business and functional requirements (BRD, FRD, SRS)

Designed and validated data models using SQL

Built executive-ready Power BI dashboards

Developed a predictive model to identify high-risk no-show appointments

Converted analytical outputs into practical business actions

##Tools & Technologies

SQL — Data modeling, validation, and business queries

Risk probabilities were translated into actionable categories, enabling:

Targeted patient follow-ups

Proactive schedule optimization

Better utilization of clinical capacity

##Business Impact

Identified potential 12–18% reduction in no-shows

Highlighted underutilized clinical capacity

Exposed patterns of revenue leakage

Enabled leadership to take proactive, data-driven decisions
